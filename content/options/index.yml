  title: About Us 
  text:
  - We are a holographic/mixed reality solution company that enhances the connection between your business or organization and your consumers through cutting-edge 3D visualization technology in real-time. Our services include creating 3D holographic solutions for outdoor and indoor advertising, transforming glass windows into digital holographic screens, developing 3D life-size virtual avatars, and crafting holographic/mixed reality presentations, speeches, campaigns, and event holograms. Our vision is to revolutionize brand communication while ensuring accessibility to a wider audience.
  - Toadlabs Technology Inc. was established in 2015 by Rajat Bangia in Guwahati as a visual production and event management company. In 2021, we relocated our headquarters to Bangalore. Initially focusing on event organization and coverage, we recognized the potential of holographic technology to elevate branding experiences for our clients. Delving deeper into holography, we discovered innovative solutions that allow viewers to experience products and content in mesmerizing 3D without the need for glasses. We believe that this technology can fundamentally transform how brands engage with their audiences.
  - At Toadlabs, we offer tailor-made solutions such as holo boxes, holographic signage, billboards, mid-air projections, interactive holographic platforms, and mixed reality solutions. With our expertise, the creation of your brand's content is limited only by your imagination.
